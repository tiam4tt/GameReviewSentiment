# Description

This project focuses on analyzing game reviews by extracting data from:

- [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/)
- [OpenCritic](https://opencritic.com/)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)

and performing sentiment analysis to determine the overall tone of the reviews. Using various data science techniques, we aim to gain insights into how games are perceived by the gaming community and identify trends in user feedback.

# Disclaimer
> The reviews from Metacritic and OpenCritic primarily come from "professional" game journalists, who have been incorporating social dilemmas and various cultural topics, particularly those related to race, into their assessments of games. This approach is unlikely to accurately depict the true value of such digital products. Consequently, all sentiments derived from this project should not be regarded as definitive or reliable.
